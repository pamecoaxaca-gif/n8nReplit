# Hi!
Hi, This repl is a template for n8n (https://n8n.io), a open source alternative for creating workflows. Workflows and configuration are persistent (they'll stay even if the repl restarts!). **Get started now by pressing the Run button!**


# Configuration
Documentation for all configuration can be found at https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/#configuration-by-file. To change something, just edit the [config](#n8n-config/config) file in the n8n-config/ folder in the sidebar. (**make sure you run the repl at least once before you can see the folder**). 

By default the database is saved in a sql file in the ``n8n/`` folder but you can change this with the config file.
